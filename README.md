# React + Vite
I have created this portfolio website using react and three.js. To make your own portfolio you can change in the constant folder according to your details. this ensures seamless changes without need to change at various places. 
Also, do check the final portfolio which I deployed using Vercel.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
